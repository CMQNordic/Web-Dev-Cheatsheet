## __Markdown__
##### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document. Files are saved as .md files and only special readers ca view it (or Chrome with plug-in). On github README.md in root is shown as main file. As best practice use markdown to style README.md file at github. A command to preview .md file in VScode is CTRL-SHIFT-V. 

###### Extensions:<br> Auto-Open Markdown Preview : Automatically opens a preview window for each opened .md file
